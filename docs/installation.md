# Installation Notes

This chapter describes the procedure to deploy the Jaeger application in the Kubernetes/OpenShift project.
The deployment includes a collector to collect the data, a query for UI purposes in a query pod
for tracing the query.

## Prerequisites

This section describes the prerequisites to deploy Jaeger in the Cloud.

### Common

* Kubernetes 1.21+ or OpenShift 4.10+
* kubectl 1.21+ or oc 4.10+ CLI
* Helm 3.0+

### Storage

#### Cassandra Storage

**Note:** This section is applicable only to cases when Cassandra is used as a store.

Supported Cassandra versions:

* 4.x (recommended)
* 3.x

Depending on the configuration of your Cassandra cluster you can configure different replication strategies
for Jaeger's data.

If your Cassandra cluster has **2 or more nodes** in the cluster, you can use data replication. It can be configured
using the deployment parameter:

```yaml
cassandraSchemaJob:
  mode: prod
```

**Note:** If you want, with 2 or more Cassandra nodes you can use a SimpleStrategy without data replication.

If your Cassandra cluster has **only 1 node**, you can use a SimpleStrategy without data replication.
It can be configured using the deployment parameter:

```yaml
cassandraSchemaJob:
  mode: test
```

**Warning!** The `mode: prod` **can't be used** if you have **only 1** Cassandra node. Jaeger won't allow to create
of a schema and other Jaeger pods won't start with this configuration.


#### OpenSearch/Elasticsearch

**Note:** This section applies only to cases when OpenSearch/Elasticsearch is used as a store.

Selecting between OpenSearch and Elasticsearch we recommended using **OpenSearch**.

Supported OpenSearch versions:

* 2.x (recommended)
* 1.x

Supported Elasticsearch versions:

* 7.x
* 6.x
* 5.x


### Kubernetes

To deploy Jaeger in the Kubernetes/OpenShift you must have at least a namespace admin role.
You should have at least permissions like the following:

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  namespace: <jaeger-namespace>
  name: deploy-user-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
```

**Note:** It's not a role that you have to create. It's just an example with a minimal list of permissions.

For Kubernetes 1.25+, it is recommended to deploy Jaeger using `baseline` PSS. Before deploying please make sure
that your namespace has the following labels:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: <name>
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: baseline
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
```

For Kubernetes 1.25+ if `restricted` PSS is specified on namespace using
`pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted`, then it is necessary to configure
`securityContext` and `containerSecurityContext` appropriately.

At the pod level, `runAsNonRoot: true` and `seccompProfile.type: "RuntimeDefault"` will be added automatically.
At the container level, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` and `capabilities.drop: - ALL` will be added automatically.
It is recommended not to override these values because Kubernetes `restricted`` PSS expects these values.


### Azure

| Azure Managed Service                                                                           | Jaeger support |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Azure CosmosDB (Cassandra)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/cosmos-db)              | ❌ Not Support  |
| [Azure Cassandra](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/managed-instance-apache-cassandra) | ❔ Not Verified |
| Azure OpenSearch                                                                                | - N/A          |

We almost didn't verify Jaeger working with Azure managed services. But we know about some GitHub issues related
to supporting Azure managed services. So we know that Jaeger doesn't support Azure CosmosDB now. GitHub issue
[Support PaaS Cassandra - Create Schema on Azure CosmosDB](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/2468).

There is no Azure managed OpenSearch. You can find only custom solutions in the Azure marketplace from other vendors.


### AWS

| AWS Managed Service       | Jaeger support |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| AWS Keyspaces (Cassandra) | ❌ Not Support  |
| AWS OpenSearch            | ✅ Support      |

Jaeger doesn't support AWS Keyspaces because Keyspaces doesn't allow to creation of frozen structures and custom
structures. GitHub issue
[Support for AWS managed Cassandra (aka AWS MCS, Amazon Keyspaces)](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/2294).

But Jaeger supports AWS OpenSearch as a managed service. Recommendation for AWS OpenSearch:

* OpenSearch 1.x and 2.x both supports
* Recommended use OpenSearch with resources not less than:
  * CPU: >= 2 cores
  * Memory: >= 4-8 GB
* To run Jaeger with AWS OpenSearch recommended using flavors not less than:
  * r5.large.search
  * m4.large.search
  * c6g.large.search
  * c5.large.search
  * c4.large.search


### Google

| Google Managed Service | Jaeger support |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Google Cassandra       | - N/A          |
| Google OpenSearch      | - N/A          |

Google has no officially managed Cassandra, OpenSearch or Elasticsearch. You can find only custom solutions
in the Google marketplace from other vendors.


## Best practices and recommendations

### HWE

The minimal hardware values with which Jaeger can start:

Collector:

| Component | CPU Requests | Memory Requests | CPU Limits | Memory Limits |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| collector | 50m          | 64Mi            | 100m       | 128Mi         |
| query     | 100m         | 64Mi            | 150m       | 128Mi         |

For more information about Jaeger's performance, refer to the [Jaeger Service Performance Monitoring](performance.md)
section in the _Cloud Platform Monitoring Guide_.

**Note**: The above resources are required for starting, not for working under load. For production, the resources
should be increased, also if needed, the collector can be scaled horizontally.

Disk space for storing Jaeger traces might be calculated in several ways:

* First of all, trace might contain more than one span, it depends on how many services (APIs) call each request.
  If you are able to calculate a number of spans as:

  ```txt
  Number of spans per second = number traces in your system(requests) * number of spans per trace
  ```

  Please note not all requests on prod env are sent traces in Jaeger, so you only need to count the traced requests.
  After that, you are able to calculate the total number of spans as:

* If you have installed Jaeger on pre-production or production env you are able to check the number of spans per second
  with Jaeger self metrics. See the "span creation rate" panel on the "Jaeger-overview" Grafana dashboard.
  Or you can calculate the value in Prometheus\/VMUI:

  ```Promql
  sum(rate(jaeger_reporter_spans[1m]))
  ```

  or

  ```Promql
  sum(rate(jaeger_collector_spans_received_total{service="jaeger-collector"}[1m]))/60
  ```

After that, you can calculate the total number of spans:

```txt
Total number of spans = Number of spans per second * Retention period in seconds
```

**Warning!** TTL for Jaeger's Cassandra tables **can't be changed** during update!
You must set correct TTL values during first deploy! If you didn't do it, please read the
[Maintenance: Change Cassandra TTL](maintenance.md#change-cassandra-ttl).

To find the retention period see `ttl` for [Cassandra](#cassandra) and `numberOfDays` for
[Elasticsearch\/OpenSearch](#index-cleaner).

We have made measurements and found that each 100000 spans requires about 90 Megabytes of disk space
or 0.9kb per span.
Also, 30% of the additional disk space is needed for storage maintenance (e.g. retention).
That means you need to allocate about 120 Megabytes of disk space for each 100k spans.

Please note that Jaeger by default trace only 1% of all traces(probabilistic sampler type).

```txt
Disk space usage(in Megabytes) = Total number of spans * 0.0009 * Probabilistic coefficient
```

For example:

Services generate 1500 spans but Jaeger will receive 10%(150 spans per second) and traces will be stored for 7 days.
So the total number of spans will be:

```txt
1500 * 0.1 * 86400(seconds per day) * 7 = 90 720 000
```

And disk space usage will be:

```txt
90 720 000 * 0.0009 = 81648Mb or (~80Gb)
80Gb + 30% = 105Gb
```

### TLS

Support matrix Jaeger as third-party:

| Connection                 | Support TLS   |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Client to Collector        | ✅ Support     |
| Collector/Query to Storage | ✅ Support     |
| Browser to UI              | ❌ Not Support |


## Parameters

This section describes parameters that can be used to deploy Jaeger and its components in the Cloud.

### Jaeger

It's a common section that contains some generic parameters.

All parameters in the table below should be specified under the key:

```


### Collector

`jaeger-collector` receives traces, runs them through a processing pipeline for validation and clean-up/enrichment,
and stores them in a storage backend. Jaeger comes with built-in support for several storage backends,
as well as an extensible plugin framework for implementing custom storage plugins.

All parameters in the table below should be specified under the key:

```yaml
collector:
  install: true
  ...
```

#### Ingress

This section describes Ingress configuration for `jaeger-collector`.

Two ingresses are created separately for `http` and `grpc` protocols. Parameters must be configured for both the
protocols under `collector.ingress` section.

```yaml
collector:
  ingress:
    http:
      install: true
    grpc:
      install: true
```

### Cassandra

**Note:** Since Jaeger release `1.57.x`, `cassandraSchemaJob.install` parameter has been removed.
`cassandraSchemaJob` will be installed if `jaeger.storage.type` is set to `cassandra`.

**Warning!** TTL for Jaeger's Cassandra tables **can't be changed** during update!
You must set correct TTL values during first deploy! If you didn't do it, please read the
[Maintenance: Change Cassandra TTL](maintenance.md#change-cassandra-ttl).

```yaml
cassandraSchemaJob:
  name: cassandra-schema-job
  ...

#### Rollover

Elasticsearch Rollover is an index management strategy that optimizes use of resources allocated to indices.
For example, indices that do not contain any data still allocate shards, and conversely, a single index might contain
significantly more data than the others.
Jaeger by default stores data in daily indices which might not optimally utilize resources.

One additional part of Elasticsearch Rollover is [Lookback job](#lookback).

More details about Elasticsearch Rollover can be found by the link
[https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/deployment/#elasticsearch-rollover](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/deployment/#elasticsearch-rollover)

**Warning!** Do not use Rollover (rollover and lookback) and IndexCleaner together. Need to use only one cleanup strategy!

All parameters in the table below should be specified under the key:

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  rollover:
    install: true
    ...
```

#### Lookback

It's a part of [Elasticsearch Rollover](#rollover) to remove old indices from read aliases.
It means that old data will not be available for search.
This imitates the behavior of `--es.max-span-age` flag used in the default index-per-day deployment.
This step could be optional and old indices could be simply removed by index cleaner in the next step.

**Warning!** Do not use Rollover (rollover and lookback) and IndexCleaner together. Need to use only one cleanup strategy!

All parameters in the table below should be specified under the key:

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  lookback:
    install: true
    ...
```

## Installation

This section describes how to install Jaeger to the Kubernetes.

### Before you begin

* Make sure that selecting Jaeger storage is alive and operable
* Make sure that you configure expected retention data settings

#### Helm

For manual installation, you have to specify images manually in `values.yaml` file.

For example, you can use the following parameters:

```yaml
collector:
  image: jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:1.62.0
query:
  image: jaegertracing/jaeger-query:1.62.0
proxy:
  image: envoyproxy/envoy:v1.25.8
cassandraSchemaJob:
  image: jaegertracing/jaeger-cassandra-schema:1.73.0
hotrod:
  image: jaegertracing/example-hotrod:1.62.0
elasticsearch:
  indexCleaner:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-es-index-cleaner:1.62.0
  rollover:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-es-rollover:1.62.0
```


### On-prem

This section contains examples of deployment parameters to deploy on-premise Clouds.

#### HA scheme

The minimal template for the HA scheme is as follows:

```yaml
jaeger:
  storage:
    type: cassandra

cassandraSchemaJob:
  host: cassandra.cassandra.svc
  keyspace: jaeger
  password: admin
  username: admin
  datacenter: dc1
  mode: prod

query:
  install: true
  replicas: 2

collector:
  install: true
  replicas: 2
```


#### Non-HA scheme

The minimal template for the Non-HA scheme is as follows:

```yaml
jaeger:
  storage:
    type: cassandra

cassandraSchemaJob:
  host: cassandra.cassandra.svc
  keyspace: jaeger
  password: admin
  username: admin
  datacenter: dc1

  # This parameter is responsible for with either with SimpleStrategy (without replication)
  # or with NetworkReplicationStrategy (with replication). NetworkReplicationStrategy can be used only
  # if Cassandra cluster has 2 or more nodes.
  # * prod - will use NetworkReplicationStrategy (replication factor = 2)
  # * test - will use SimpleStrategy
  mode: prod

query:
  install: true

collector:
  install: true
```



## Post Deploy Checks

There are some options to check after deploy that Jaeger deployed and working correctly.


### Smoke test

This section contains some steps that can help to check Jaeger's deploy and verify that it has minimal functionality.

Firstly, check deploy and pod statuses of storage used for Jaeger. For example, you can check at least that
all pods are running and didn't restart.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

**Note:** In case, when storage will use any managed service like AWS OpenSearch, you need to check that
this service is activated in your account and is working now.

Second, you can check that all components are up using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <jaeger_namespace>
```

For example, a typical Jaeger deployment contains the following pods:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n tracing
NAME                                    READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
jaeger-collector-f8c869f8b-jr7tn    1/1     Running     0          4m24s
jaeger-query-7c84bb9c96-cmlh2       1/1     Running     0          4m24s
```

Jaeger deployment also can contain some additional pods like `jaeger-agent` or `jaeger-hotrod`,
but they are optional.

Also, you can see `jaeger-cassandra-schema-job` if execute `kubectl get pods ...` quickly after run deploy.
This job is created by Helm pre-hook and should be removed after successful completion.

Or you can use the Kubernetes Dashboard to see pods and their statuses in the UI.

You can use the command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> --selector=app.kubernetes.io/name=qubership-diag-proxy
```

**Note:** Please pay attention that `qubership-diag-proxy` deployment and pod should be not in the namespace
with Jaeger. It should deploy in the namespace with an application.

If it is presented, you need to check that in environment variables it contains the variable:

```yaml
- name: JAEGER_COLLECTOR_HOST
  value: <jaeger-collector-service>
```

For example:

```yaml
- name: JAEGER_COLLECTOR_HOST
  value: jaeger-collector.jaeger.svc
```

To print a list of environment variables you can use the command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> --selector=app.kubernetes.io/name=qubership-diag-proxy -o yaml
```

Or you can use the Kubernetes Dashboard to check `qubership-diag-proxy` and its settings.

Fourth, you can check that Jaeger has collected the traces using the following command:

```bash
wget -O - http://<jaeger query pod ip or service name>:16686/api/traces/<trace_id>
```

or

```bash
curl -X GET http://<jaeger query pod ip or service name>:16686/api/traces/<trace_id>
```

Or you can use Jaeger UI to check the list of services and traces.
If you don't know any `<trace_id>` you can just try to check that th UI is working now:

```bash
wget -O - http://<jaeger query pod ip or service name>:16686
```

or

```bash
curl -X GET http://<jaeger query pod ip or service name>:16686
```

Or you can use Jaeger UI to check that it works without any errors.

If you have deployed a CloudCore-base application, you can try to find any traces of the `gateway` service.
To find it in UI you need:

* Go to Jaeger UI
* Select `gateway` in the dropdown list of the "Service" parameter
* Click "Find Traces"
* Check that traces collected and available


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Jaeger Sampling Configuration

Jaeger collector sampling configuration can be configured in the `jaeger.serviceName-sampling-configuration` config map.
For more information, refer to _Collector Sampling Configuration Documentation_ at
[https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/sampling/#collector-sampling-configuration](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/sampling/#collector-sampling-configuration).
You need to manually restart collector pods after updating the config map. Updating Jaeger recreates the config map,
so you have to edit it again.

**Note**: The application uses collector sampling configuration only if it is configured to use a remote sampler.
In other cases, the configuration is done on the application side.
