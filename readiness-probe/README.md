    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```

### Deploy to k8s

For more details, see [Jaeger's Installation Guide: Readiness Probe](/docs/public/installation.md#readiness-probe).

### Smoke tests

There are no smoke tests.

### How to debug

Readiness probe is a simple application to check if Jaeger is ready. It may be useful to check logs to debug issues.

### How to troubleshoot

Readiness probe issues can be troubleshooted by mostly checking logs from the pods' containers.
